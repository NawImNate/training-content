Author: Joshua Leisure

Start with a lesson goal, what should the viewer be taking away from this lesson and a brief preview of the content. 

For example: "In this lesson, we will cover loops, with our goals being to learn what they are, what they do, and how they are important in Javascript. Additionally, the different types of loops and how their neccessity will vary per situation."

## Next, we will try to keep our headings consistent by using "##"
- For content below a head, there is the option of using bullet points or paragraphs. This is up to author and author's style choice, for example, you could write a paragraph explaing the importance of loops, then using bullets (-) to describe the syntax or key points. Try to keep numbered list to a minimum and only use them when trying to do steps or rank the importance of something.

## Table of contents
- We will have a table of contents per page on the left side of the page, just to let the user scroll/click to their desired section to review/look at to make things quicker for the user.

## References and author
- These will still be at placed at the bottom of the page but inserted in the front matter.
