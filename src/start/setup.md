To follow along, you will need some develper tools:

1. A modern browser - any browser with advanced "developer tools" will do. Examples are Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.
2. A modern code editor - we are going to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. A decent terminal & shell. Linux and Mac already have it (as "terminal").
   * On Windows, you should install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and make sure you [make `bash` your default shell in VS Code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994).
4. And when we get a bit advanced, you will also need [NodeJS, NPM, etc](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
5. Eventually, every professional developer must use version control in general, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in particular. So learn it.

## Know your tools

Spend some time learning your tools. What features and commands they provide. Especially learn the keyboard shortcuts.

1. VS Code: [Tips and Tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks), includes keyboard shortcut cheatsheets.
   * [Integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal): Use command shell from within VS Code.
   * [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet): A highly productive way to enter HTML.
   * [Version Control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol): Use Git and other version control systems.
   * [Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace): Extend the functionality of VS Code. Definitely install the following extensions:
     * [Live Server](vscode:extension/ritwickdey.LiveServer): Lets you run a small web server within VS Code to serve your project's HTML files and view them in your browser.
2. In-Browser Developer Tools: [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools), [Chrome/Chromium/Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/)
3. [Learn Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).
