# SpinSpire Training Content

This is the source repo for training content produced by SpinSpire team. The course material is intended to be consumed by trainees/students from a static site generated from this content.

It uses the follwing:

- [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (\*.md) is the source format, which is a text-like format that gets converted to HTML files during build
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is the static site generator
- [Nunjucks templating language](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is used for layouts and sometimes NJK is included in the markdown files themselves (although that should be minimized)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) is the CSS framework to make the HTML look pretty

## Setup

We use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for package management, so please install it using `npm install -g pnpm`.

```bash
git clone url-of-this-repo
cd training-content
pnpm install
pnpm start #live development: runs watch and serves site
pnpm run build #compile for deployment
```

## How to write content

- Create/update modules in \*.md files in `src` directory
  - Use VS Code and it's "Markdown All in One" extension
  - Run the `pnpm dev` live server above to see changes in real-time
  - You could also use the <kbd>Ctr-Shift-V</kbd> or <kdb>Cmd-Shift-V</kbd> to preview markdown rendering within VS Code
- Add the `category` field in front-matter
- If you invent new `category` then don't forget to also add it to `index.md` front-matter `categories` field
- Use `weight` field to control the order of modules within a category
- Use `references` as appropriate
- In general, make sure you review the existing modules, and follow the existing style in both content and code

## How to code (for Static Site Generation)

- `src`
  - `index.md`: home page
  - `_includes/default.njk`: default layout, edit this for most HTML changes outside the markdown
- `.eleventy.js`: 11ty [configuration](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/)
- `package.json`: You know what this does. If not, don't touch.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: This is generated by `pnpm install`. Don't edit by hand, but do commit if it changes.
- `docker-*` and `.env.example`: Docker related. Advanced uses only.
  - If you want to run under Docker, then copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it before use.
